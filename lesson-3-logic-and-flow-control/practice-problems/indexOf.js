/*
Write two functions that each take two strings as arguments. Their expected
behaviors are as follows:

    The indexOf function searches for the first instance of a substring in
    firstString that matches the string secondString, and returns the index of the
    character where that substring begins.

    The lastIndexOf function searches for the last instance of a substring in
    firstString that matches the string secondString, and returns the index of the
    character where that substring begins.

    Both functions return -1 if firstString does not contain the substring
    specified by secondString.
